The earth dilutes again as May approaches
The filthy kind, the Sahara rebel 
Your lord is angry, yet welcoming another lamb
Will you send him my best wishes?
Eighteen years of slaughter and dirt, is this the final sacrifice?
Will He still be burning next year? I suppose not, 
Just reminded of the wool I carry
As his white puppets frolic across the garden
The wind remembers too, and maybe they’re all I’ll have
And maybe that’ll keep me warm enough.
